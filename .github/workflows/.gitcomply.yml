  - Any missing defaults are injected into workflows before execution.
  - In strict/paranoid, denials from linked policies can block merges or deploys.

  with:
    # A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore

    # An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache
    key: 
    # An ordered multiline string listing the prefix-matched keys, that are used for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key. Note `cache-hit` returns false in this case.

    # The chunk size used to split up large files during upload, in bytes
    upload-chunk-size: # optional
    # An optional boolean when enabled, allows windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms
